Installation
=============
In order to get started with MOAFS, you need to download it on your computer. 
There are two main ways to to this:

*   You can click on this link
*   Or you can clone the github repository and get the file from your local copy:

### Downloading from the repository

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/mbdemoraes/moafs
  cd lib
 
After the download, just add the `moafs.jar` file in the "lib" folder on the directory where MOA is installed. It can be done manually or via terminal. 
Here is an example doing this from terminal using `cp` command in Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

  cp moafs.jar /home/Documents/athos/MOA/lib

Where `/home/Documents/athos/MOA/lib` is the directory where MOA is installed.
